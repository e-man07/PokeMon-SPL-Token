#PokeMon Token

PokeMon is a custom Solana SPL token developed using TypeScript, @solana/web3.js, and Metaplex's Umi library for adding metadata. This project enables the creation, minting, and management of SPL tokens, including custom metadata, on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its fast, low-cost transaction capabilities.

#Overview
The PokeMon token project demonstrates how to create and manage an SPL token on the Solana blockchain using @solana/web3.js and Umi for metadata management. Built in TypeScript, the project ensures type safety and smooth interaction with Solana’s infrastructure. The token can be integrated into various decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts within the Solana ecosystem.

Features
SPL Token Standard: Fully compliant with Solana’s SPL token standard.
TypeScript-based: Built using TypeScript for better maintainability and developer experience.
@solana/web3.js: Utilizes the Solana Web3 JavaScript library to interact with the blockchain.
Umi for Metadata: Leverages Metaplex’s Umi library to attach metadata to the token, such as name, symbol, and description.
Minting and Transfers: Capable of minting new tokens and transferring them between Solana addresses.
Fast and Cost-Effective: Leveraging Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs.

Prerequisites
To run this project locally, you need the following:

Node.js (version 16.x or higher)
npm or yarn package manager
Solana CLI (for deploying on localnet/devnet/mainnet)
Phantom Wallet (optional for interacting with tokens via a browser extension)

Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/PokeMon-Token.git
cd PokeMon-Token
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure to install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:

bash

npm install
# or
yarn install

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the project root to store your Solana wallet private key and cluster information (devnet or mainnet).

bash

WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=<Your_Private_Key>
CLUSTER_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com

Usage

Create a New Token
Run the following script to create a new SPL token:

bash

npm run create-token

This will generate a new SPL token and print the token public key for further operations.

Mint New Tokens
To mint new tokens to a specified wallet address:

bash

npm run mint-token -- --recipient <Recipient_Wallet_Address> --amount <Amount>

Transfer Tokens
To transfer tokens between wallets:

bash

npm run transfer-token -- --from <Sender_Wallet_Address> --to <Recipient_Wallet_Address> --amount <Amount>

Deployment
You can deploy the PokeMon token on either the Solana devnet, testnet, or mainnet.

Deploying to Devnet

Make sure your wallet has enough SOL (you can request some from the devnet faucet).
Set the environment variable CLUSTER_URL to https://api.devnet.solana.com.
Use the provided commands to create and interact with the token.
For deploying to the mainnet, update the CLUSTER_URL to the mainnet endpoint and ensure you have sufficient SOL in your wallet.
