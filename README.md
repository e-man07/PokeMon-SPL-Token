# **PokeMon Token**

PokeMon is a custom Solana SPL token developed using TypeScript, @solana/web3.js, and Metaplex's Umi library for adding metadata. This project enables the creation, minting, and management of SPL tokens, including custom metadata, on the Solana blockchain, leveraging its fast, low-cost transaction capabilities.

## **Overview**

The PokeMon token project demonstrates how to create and manage an SPL token on the Solana blockchain using @solana/web3.js and Umi for metadata management. Built in TypeScript, the project ensures type safety and smooth interaction with Solana’s infrastructure. The token can be integrated into various decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts within the Solana ecosystem.

## **Features**

1. SPL Token Standard: Fully compliant with Solana’s SPL token standard.
2. TypeScript-based: Built using TypeScript for better maintainability and developer experience.
3. @solana/web3.js: Utilizes the Solana Web3 JavaScript library to interact with the blockchain.
4. Umi for Metadata: Leverages Metaplex’s Umi library to attach metadata to the token, such as name, symbol, and description.
5. Minting and Transfers: Capable of minting new tokens and transferring them between Solana addresses.
6. Fast and Cost-Effective: Leveraging Solana’s high throughput and low transaction costs.

## **Prerequisites**

To run this project locally, you need the following:

Node.js (version 16.x or higher)
npm or yarn package manager
Solana CLI (for deploying on localnet/devnet/mainnet)
Phantom Wallet (optional for interacting with tokens via a browser extension)
